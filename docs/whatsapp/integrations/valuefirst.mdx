### Step 1. Account Setup

1. If you do not have an account with ValueFirst yet, you will have to create an
   enterprise account by contacting their support
   [here](https://www.vfirst.com/say-ahoy). If you choose an enterprise account,
   their support team will help you with the whole setup process. In brief,
   below are the steps that would be required -

- You would need a verified Facebook Business Manager account. To create a FB
  Business Manager account, refer to the
  [Facebook's guide on creating a business manager account](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/1710077379203657?id=180505742745347)
  and then
  [verify your account](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/2058515294227817?id=180505742745347).
- You will need a
  [unique phone number](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/phone-numbers)
  and a
  [display name](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/guides/display-name/)
  to be registered with WhatsApp.
- Fill your Business details in Gupshup. They will then create a WA business
  account with Facebook, which may take upto 7 days.
- Next, you need to approve Gupshup to send messages from your WhatsApp business
  account on behalf of your business. Check
  [how to approve this request](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/524220081677109?id=2129163877102343).
