### Step 1. Account Setup

If you do not have an account with Smooch yet, you can create an account
[here](https://smooch.io/signup/) or contact their support team. Follow their
WhatsApp onboarding doc [here](https://docs.smooch.io/guide/whatsapp/#accounts)
to get the setup done. Their onboarding setup will help you create a Facebook
Business Manager account and enable WhatsApp on Smooch.

### Step 3. Delivery Reports

Follow the steps to setup delivery reports:

1. On the Raven dashboard, once you successfully add the Kaleyra Integration,
   you will see it in the "Live" tab. Go to the Live tab, and click on Kaleyra
   WhatsApp. You will see a URL as **Status Webhook**, present in the
   integration. Copy this URL.
2. Log in to Smooch dashboard. Go to the webhooks section and paste the Status
   Webhook URL copied in Step 1.

<Info>
  Raven supports sending both Session messaging (User initiated) and Template
  messaging (Business initiated). Support for handling incoming messages for
  session messaging is coming soon.
