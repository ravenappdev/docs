### Step 1. Account Setup

If you do not have an account with Twilio yet, create an account
[here](https://www.twilio.com/docs/usage/tutorials/how-to-use-your-free-trial-account).
Twilio also provides a
[WhatsApp sandbox](https://www.twilio.com/docs/whatsapp/sandbox) which you can
use to test. To setup your WhatsApp account you can refer to Twilio's set of
guides
[here](https://www.twilio.com/docs/whatsapp/tutorial/connect-number-business-profile).

### Step 2. Twilio Integration in Raven

| Keys          | Details                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Account SID` | Twilio Account SID. You can find it [here](https://www.twilio.com/login?g=%2Fconsole%3F&t=2b1c98334b25c1a785ef15b6556396290e3c704a9b57fc40687cbccd79c46a8c).                                                  |
| `Auth Key`    | Twilio Account Token. You can find it [here](https://www.twilio.com/login?g=%2Fconsole%3F&t=2b1c98334b25c1a785ef15b6556396290e3c704a9b57fc40687cbccd79c46a8c).                                                |
| `From`        | This must be a Twilio phone number that you own. Create one [here](https://www.twilio.com/login?g=%2Fconsole%2Fphone-numbers%2Fsearch%3F&t=a3134facff1edad5ee8c40d35c3a85606f3a8f8a2dfeb64c6f4aedcf3f06da20). |

### Step 3. Delivery Reports

There is no additional configuration required to setup delivery reports. Raven
manages the delivery callback internally for Twilio.

<Info>
  Raven supports sending both Session messaging (User initiated) and Template
  messaging (Business initiated). Support for handling incoming messages for
  session messaging is coming soon.

### Advanced

addresses are whitelisted and not blocked.
