their WhatsApp onboarding doc

Business Manager account and enable WhatsApp on Kaleyra.

### Step 3. Delivery Reports

Follow the steps to setup delivery reports:

1. On the Raven dashboard, once you successfully add the Gupshup Integration,
   you will see it in the "Live" tab. Go to the Live tab, and click on Kaleyra
   WhatsApp. You will see a URL as **Status Webhook**, present in the
   integration. Copy this URL.
2. Log in to Kaleyra console. Go to Settings > Enable WhatsApp Callback URLs to
   whitelist this callback url. Paste the Status Webhook URL copied in Step 1.
