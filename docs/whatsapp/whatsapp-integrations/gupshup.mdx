### Step 1. Account Setup

1. If you do not have an account with Gupshup yet, you can create an account
   directly by signing up
   [here](https://www.gupshup.io/channels/self-serve/whatsapp) or contact their
   support if you require an
   [enterprise account](https://enterprise.smsgupshup.com/whatsapp).
2. If you choose an enterprise account, their support team will help you with
   the whole setup process. If you are using Gupshup's self-serve portal, you
   can integrate Gupshup before going live. Check their
   [FAQs](https://www.gupshup.io/resources/faq/whatsapp-faq/) for more details.
   Below are the steps if you need to do once you decide to go live -
   - You would need a verified Facebook Business Manager account. To create a FB
     Business Manager account, refer to the
     [Facebook's guide on creating a business manager account](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/1710077379203657?id=180505742745347)
     and then
     [verify your account](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/2058515294227817?id=180505742745347).
   - You will need a
     [unique phone number](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/phone-numbers)
     and a
     [display name](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/guides/display-name/)
     to be registered with WhatsApp.
   - Fill your Business details in Gupshup. They will then create a WA business
     account with Facebook, which may take upto 7 days.
   - Next, you need to approve Gupshup to send messages from your WhatsApp
     business account on behalf of your business. Check
     [how to approve this request](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/524220081677109?id=2129163877102343).

Follow the steps to setup delivery reports:

1. On the Raven dashboard, once you successfully add the Gupshup Integration,
   you will see it in the "Live" tab. Go to the Live tab, and click on Gupshup
   WhatsApp. You will see a URL as **Status Webhook**, present in the
   integration. Copy this URL.
2. Log in to Gupshup console. Go to App Settings to set the callback url. Paste
   the Status Webhook URL copied in Step 1. Check
