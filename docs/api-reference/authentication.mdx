title: "Authentication "
---

The Raven API uses API keys to authenticate requests. You can view API Key for your account in the [Raven Dashboard](https://console.ravenapp.dev/app/management/settings) (Dashboard -> Settings -> Account -> Account Details)

Raven API Key is common for all the apps in the account.

Do not share your API keys in publicly accessible areas such as GitHub, client-side code, and so forth.

All API requests must be made over HTTPS. Calls made over plain HTTP will fail. API requests without authentication will also fail.
