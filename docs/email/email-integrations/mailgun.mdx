### Step 1. Account Setup

- If you do not have an account with Mailgun yet, create an account here.

- Next you need to verify your domain. To create and verify a domain, please
  follow the Mailgun guide
  [here](https://documentation.mailgun.com/en/latest/user_manual.html#verifying-your-domain-1).
  Your account will have a sandbox domain initially, with which you can test
  emails with upto 5
  [authorized recipients](https://help.mailgun.com/hc/en-us/articles/217531258-Authorized-Recipients).

Step 2. Mailgun Integration in Raven

<Info>
  We currently only support sending emails via the Mailgun REST API and not the
  SMTP interface.

### Step 3. Delivery Reports

Follow the steps to setup delivery reports:

1. On the Raven dashboard, once you successfully add the Mailgun Integration,
   you will see it in the "Live" tab. Go to the Live tab, and click on Mailgun
   Email. You will see a URL as **Status Webhook**, present in the integration.
   Copy this URL.
2. Log in to Mailgun and go to Sending > Webhooks.
3. Create a Webhook and Paste the Status Webhook URL copied in Step 1.

## 💫 Advanced

**Send additional parameters to Mailgun**

Raven will send the fields present in the Email template to Mailgun by default.
Additionally, you can send "cc", "bcc", "From Name", "Reply-to" fields in the
Send Event API. This will override the fields added in the Integration. Please
check our Override doc here.

**IP Whitelisting**

You can control access to Mailgun by specifying Raven's IP address, or make sure
Raven's IP addresses are not blocked. Please follow the Mailgun guide
[here](https://help.mailgun.com/hc/en-us/articles/360012244474-IP-Allowlist).

    IPs: 65.2.109.100, 65.2.58.233
