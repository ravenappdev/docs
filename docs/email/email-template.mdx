The email template is comprised of 3 parts -

1. Subject
2. Body
3. Attachments

While the subject is pretty straightforward, the email body needs to be provided
in HTML. If you have email templates designed already, you can just copy-paste
the HTML.

**Attachments**

For attachments, you can add new attachments to the template as many as you
would want to send. Each attachment has a type, file data key and a file name
key. The file data key and file name key would be like `{{attachment_1}}` and
`{{attachment_name_1}}`. The type specifies whether the attachment is a text
file or some other format (PDF, JPEG etc). The attachment data should be encoded
in Base64 encoding and passed as a value to the file data key in the Send Event
API. Also, the name of the attachment that you want to send in the email should
be passed as a value to the file name key.

**Headers**

You can add email headers like reply-to, sender etc in the Integration tab while
setting up the email provider integration.

### Dynamic Content

Any dynamic content can be supplied in the template in handlebars. For example:
`{{name}}`. Raven will replace these variables with the value passed in the Send
Event API.
