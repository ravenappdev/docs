### Step 1. Account Setup

- To access Amazon SES, you need to
  [Sign up for AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/setting-up.html)
  first.
- Before you send email through Amazon SES, you need to verify that you own the
  "From" address.
- Initially your SES account will be in Sandbox, and you will be allowed to send
  emails to only verified emails. You can verify all your "To" addresses or
  domains. For more information, see
  [Verifying identities in Amazon SES](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/verify-addresses-and-domains.html).
  In the AWS SES sandbox, you can only send emails to addresses/domains you have
  verified. Also, it has a quota of 200 emails per 24-hour period at a maximum
  rate of one email per second. To increase your sending quotas and to send
  email to unverified email addresses, see
  [Moving out of the Amazon SES sandbox](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/request-production-access.html).

<Note>Make sure to enable production access before you go live.</Note>

### Step 2. AWS SES Integration in Raven

| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `From Address`      | Your verified "From" email address                                                                                                                                                  |
| `From Name`         | "From Name" of your emails. You can also pass this in the Send Event API. Check the Advanced section below.                                                                         |
| `Access Key ID`     | Your AWS Access Key ID. To get your access credentials, check [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-sec-cred-types.html#access-keys-and-secret-access-keys).     |
| `Secret Access Key` | Your AWS Secret Access Key. To get your access credentials, check [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-sec-cred-types.html#access-keys-and-secret-access-keys). |
| `Region`            | Your AWS Region. Default is "ap-south-1".                                                                                                                                           |
| `Reply to Address`  | Reply email address. You can also pass this in the Send Event API. Check the Advanced section below.                                                                                |

<Info>
  We currently only support sending emails via the SES REST API and not the SMTP
  interface.
</Info>

<Warning>

For security best practice, use AWS IAM user access keys instead of AWS account
access keys. Your AWS account credentials grant full access to all your AWS
resources, so you should instead use IAM user credentials. For more information,
see
[Root Account Credentials vs. IAM User Credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/root-vs-iam.html).

</Warning>

### Step 3. Delivery Reports

Setting up Delivery Reports for Emails sent via SES is a bit tricky and requires
you to setup AWS SNS. We will soon be updating the steps to setup delivery
reports. For more information you can refer the
[AWS guide to configure SNS for SES](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/configure-sns-notifications.html).

## ðŸ’« Advanced

**Send additional parameters to AWS SES**

Raven will send the fields present in the Email template to SES by default.
Additionally, you can send "cc", "bcc", "From Name", "Reply-to" fields in the
Send Event API. This will override the fields added in the Integration. Please
check our Override doc here.

**IP Whitelisting**

You can control access to SES by specifying Raven's IP address, or make sure
Raven's IP addresses are not blocked. Please follow the AWS guide
[here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/control-user-access.html).

    IPs: 65.2.109.100, 65.2.58.233
