### Step 1. Account Setup

- If you do not have an account with SendGrid yet, create an account
  [here](https://signup.sendgrid.com/).

- Next you need to verify your domain. To create and verify a domain, please
  follow the SendGrid guide
  [here](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/account-and-settings/how-to-set-up-domain-authentication).
  In the [free plan](https://sendgrid.com/free/) you can send upto 100
  emails/day for free.

### Step 2. Sendgrid Integration in Raven

| Keys               | Details                                                                                                               |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `From Address`     | Your verified "From" email address                                                                                    |
| `From Name`        | "From Name" of your emails. You can also pass this in the Send Event API. Check the Advanced section below.           |
| `API Key`          | Your SendGrid API Key. To get your API key, check [here](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/account-and-settings/api-keys). |
| `Reply to Address` | Reply email address. You can also pass this in the Send Event API. Check the Advanced section below.                  |

  We currently only support sending emails via the SendGrid REST API and not the
  SMTP interface.

### Step 3. Delivery Reports

Follow the steps to setup delivery reports:

1. On the Raven dashboard, once you successfully add the SendGrid Integration,
   you will see it in the "Live" tab. Go to the Live tab, and click on SendGrid
   Email. You will see a URL as **Status Webhook**, present in the integration.
   Copy this URL.
2. Login to SendGrid and go to Settings > Mail Settings. Create an Event
   Webhook. Follow the steps mentioned
   [here](https://docs.sendgrid.com/for-developers/tracking-events/getting-started-event-webhook).
3. Paste the Status Webhook URL copied in Step 1.

**Send additional parameters to SendGrid**

Raven will send the fields present in the Email template to SendGrid by default.
Additionally, you can send "cc", "bcc", "From Name", "Reply-to" fields in the
Send Event API. This will override the fields added in the Integration. Please
check our Override doc here.

**IP Whitelisting**

You can control access to SendGrid by specifying Raven's IP address, or make
sure Raven's IP addresses are not blocked. Please follow the SendGrid guide
[here](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/account-and-settings/ip-access-management).

    IPs: 65.2.109.100, 65.2.58.233
