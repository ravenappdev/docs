### Step 1. Account Setup

- If you do not have an account with Postmark yet, create an account
  [here](https://account.postmarkapp.com/sign_up).

- Next, you will need to verify the email address you send from, in the
  [Signatures section](https://account.postmarkapp.com/login). You can also try
  Postmark's sandbox mode initially. Their free plan offers 100 free emails/day.
  More details on the Sandbox
  [here](https://postmarkapp.com/developer/user-guide/sandbox-mode).

  SMTP interface.

### Step 3. Delivery Reports

Follow the steps to setup delivery reports:

1. On the Raven dashboard, once you successfully add the Postmark Integration,
   you will see it in the "Live" tab. Go to the Live tab, and click on Postmark
   Email. You will see a URL as **Status Webhook**, present in the integration.
   Copy this URL.
2. Login to Postmark and go to Webhook tab. Follow the steps mentioned
   [here](https://postmarkapp.com/developer/webhooks/delivery-webhook#set-the-webhook-url).
3. Paste the Status Webhook URL copied in Step 1.

**Send additional parameters to Postmark**

Raven will send the fields present in the Email template to Postmark by default.
Additionally, you can send "cc", "bcc", "From Name", "Reply-to" fields in the
Send Event API. This will override the fields added in the Integration. Please
check our Override doc here.

**IP Whitelisting**

You can control access to Postmark by specifying Raven's IP address, or make
sure Raven's IP addresses are not blocked.

    IPs: 65.2.109.100, 65.2.58.233
