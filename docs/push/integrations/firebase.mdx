### Step 1. Setup

1. Firebase has a great platform wise documentation on how to setup Firebase
   Cloud Messaging (FCM) for Android, iOS and Web. Please follow the steps if
   you have not setup FCM yet.
   - [Android setup](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/android/client).
   - [iOS setup](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/ios/client).
   - [Web setup](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/js/client).

You can also check these Github example projects for
[Android](https://github.com/firebase/quickstart-android/blob/master/messaging/README.md),
[iOS](https://github.com/firebase/quickstart-ios/tree/master/messaging/) and
[Web](https://github.com/firebase/quickstart-js/blob/master/messaging/README.md).

### Step 2. Firebase Integration in Raven

| Keys         | Details                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Server Key` | Your project's server key. Go to Project Settings > Cloud Messaging. More details [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37427709/firebase-messaging-where-to-get-server-key/37427911#37427911). |
| `Sender ID`  | Your project's Sender ID. Go to Project Settings > Cloud Messaging. More details [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37427709/firebase-messaging-where-to-get-server-key/37427911#37427911).  |

### Step 3. Managing Tokens

Firebase identifies each device by generating a unique registration token on the
client side for each install. You can either manage the tokens on your backend,
or let Raven manage the tokens for you.

1. Manage yourself: You can follow the Firebase guide
   [here](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/manage-tokens).
2. Managed by Raven: You can use the Raven Client SDK to send the tokens
   generated from the client to Raven server ( setDeviceToken method in the
   SDK). Please refer to our Client SDK section for more details. Raven will
   take care of the active/stale tokens and will keep the tokens updated.

<Info>
If you user FCM tokens are managed by Raven, you need to also set the user-id via the Client SDK. Raven will then manage the users and map the user-id with the FCM token. You should then send the user-id in the user object of Send Event API when triggering a notification.

If you are managing tokens yourself, you would need to send the FCM token
instead. Please check our Send Event API docs for more details.

</Info>

### Step 4. Sending Notifications

Here's how you can pass fcm tokens in user object in
[Send Event API](/api-reference/send-event):

```json
{
   "user" : {
      "fcm_tokens" : ["fcm_token_1", "fcm_token_2",..]
   }
}
```

### Step 5. Notification Rendering

Notification rendering should be handled by you on the client side using the
Firebase SDK. Please refer to the platform wise Firebase guide on displaying
notifications.

1. [Android](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/android/receive)
2. [iOS](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/ios/receive)
3. [Web](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/js/receive)

### Step 6. Delivery Reports

Since Firebase does not send any delivery callbacks to server, delivery reports
need to be setup using the Client SDK. You can integrate the Raven Client SDK
and use the `updateStatus` method to send the notification status to Raven
server. Please refer to our Client SDK section for more details.

### Advanced

**Send additional parameters to Firebase**

Raven will send the fields present in the Push template to Firebase by default.
Check our Push Template section to see which fields are sent to Firebase. Also,
you can send other additional parameters directly to Firebase in the Send Event
API as shown below.

```json
"override" : {
    "providers" : {
       "<FIREBASE_INTEGRATION_NAME>": {   //integration name
           payload: {
               "<key>": "<value>" //key-values to be passed
               ...
           }
       }
    }
 }
```

Check our [Send Event API doc](/api-reference/send-event) for the complete
request.
