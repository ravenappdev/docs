### Step 1. Setup

1. If you do not have an account with OneSignal yet, you can quickly get
   onboarded by following their
   [guide](https://documentation.onesignal.com/docs/onboarding-with-onesignal).
2. Once your account is setup, you need to integrate OneSignal on your client
   side. Please follow the guide if you haven't setup the OneSignal SDK yet.
   - [Mobile](https://documentation.onesignal.com/docs/mobile-sdk-setup)
     (Android, iOS, React Native, Flutter etc).
   - [Web](https://documentation.onesignal.com/docs/web-push-quickstart)

### Step 2. Firebase Integration in Raven

| Keys               | Details                                                                                                                                     |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `OneSignal App ID` | Public Key used for initialisation and app identification. More details [here](https://documentation.onesignal.com/docs/accounts-and-keys). |
| `API Key`          | Private key used for most API calls. More details [here](https://documentation.onesignal.com/docs/accounts-and-keys).                       |

### Step 3. Managing Tokens

OneSignal automatically creates an identifier per device which is a unique
OneSignal User ID aka player_id. The external_user_id is an identifier you set,
which helps map your unique database User ID's to the OneSignal player_id device
record. This could be any unique identifier even an email or mobile. More
details on OneSignal user subscription
[here](https://documentation.onesignal.com/docs/users).

### Step 4. Sending Notifications

Raven currently supports sending OneSignal push notifications only via the
[external_user_id](https://documentation.onesignal.com/docs/external-user-ids).
This means you will have to set this via the OneSignal SDK or their API. You can
then send the external_user_id as onesignal_external_id in the user object of
Send Event API when triggering a notification. Please check our
[Send Event API docs](/api-reference/send-event) for more details.

Here's how you should pass onesignal external id in user object in
[Send Event API](/api-reference/send-event):

```json User Object
{
  "user": {
    "onesignal_external_id": "<your_onesignal_external_id>"
  }
}
```

### Step 5. Notification Rendering

Notification rendering is handled by the OneSignal SDK or by you. If you choose
to render the notifications yourself, you can check OneSignal's event handler
doc
([mobile](https://documentation.onesignal.com/docs/sdk-notification-event-handlers)
&
[web](https://documentation.onesignal.com/docs/web-push-sdk#receiving-notifications))
for more details.

### Step 6. Delivery Reports

Delivery reports need to be setup using the Raven Client SDK. You can integrate
the Raven Client SDK and use the `updateStatus` method to send the notification
status to Raven server. Please refer to our Client SDK section for more details.

### Advanced

**Send additional parameters to OneSignal**

Raven will send the fields present in the Push template to OneSignal by default.
Check our Push Template section to see which fields are sent to OneSignal. Also,
you can send other additional parameters directly to OneSignal in the Send Event
API as shown below.

```json
"override" : {
    "providers" : {
       "<ONESIGNAL_INTEGRATION_NAME>": {   //integration name
           payload: {
               "<key>": "<value>" //key-values to be passed
               ...
           }
       }
    }
 }
```

Check our [Send Event API doc](/api-reference/send-event) for the complete
request.
