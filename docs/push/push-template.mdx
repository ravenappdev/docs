1. Manage (Create/Update) your users and their preferences on Raven.
2. Manage Push tokens on Raven.

### Setup

If you want the SDK to handle users, manage tokens and also render Push
Notifications using Firebase, go for Setup #1. Otherwise, if you want the SDK to
manage only the users or tokens, check Setup #2. In the 2nd setup, you will have
to handle the rendering of notifications yourself.

**Setup #1**

This setup helps you quickly get started with Push Notifications using Firebase.
It assumes you have already setup Raven console with a Firebase Integration and
created an event with a Push template as defined [here](/push/push-template).
Then follow these steps -

1. Setup Firebase:

   - [Create](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/android/client#create_a_firebase_project)
     your Firebase project.
   - [Register](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/android/client#register_your_app_with_firebase)
     your app with Firebase.
   - [Add](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/android/client#add_a_firebase_configuration_file)
     a Firebase configuration file.

2. Once Firebase is successfully setup, add the following in your project
   gradle:

```json Gradle
allprojects {
    repositories {
        google()
        jcenter()
        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
    }
}
```

3. Add the following library in your app gradle. Please check the latest version
   [here](https://jitpack.io/#ravenappdev/raven-fcm-util).

```json Gradle
implementation 'com.github.ravenappdev:raven-fcm-util:1.0.6'
```

4. Initialize the SDK in Application onCreate

```json Gradle
RavenSdk.initialize(this, YOUR_APP_ID, YOUR_ACCOUNT_API_KEY)
```

5. Set user on signup/login. You can use any of the following methods to set
   user. Note that this will create a user if it does not exists in Raven. If it
   exists, it will simply update the user if there is any change.

```javascript
RavenSdk.setUserMobile(USER_ID, MOBILE);
RavenSdk.setUserEmail(USER_ID, EMAIL);
RavenSdk.setUser(USER_ID, MOBILE, EMAIL);
```

6. Set Firebase token after setting up user. This method will first retrieve the
   token and associate it with the user that was set earlier.

```javascript
FirebaseMessagingService.setFirebaseToken();
```

7. To handle Notification clicks, you need to set intent-filter on the activity
   that you wish to open. The intent filter action corresponds to the
   click_action value in the Push template.

```html
<intent-filter>
  <action android:name="android.intent.action.MAIN" />
  <category android:name="android.intent.category.LAUNCHER" />
</intent-filter>
```

8. When the user logs out of your app, we need to de-register the device token.
   Call logout to logout the user from Raven.

```javascript
RavenSdk.logout();
```

That's all! The SDK will manage users, tokens and handle rendering of Push
Notifications.

    Setting user preferences from SDK will be added soon.

**Setup #2**

This setup helps you to set user and manage tokens on Raven. It assumes you
already have setup Firebase and are handling the rendering of notifications
yourself. Also, you must setup a Firebase Integration on the console and create
an event with a Push template as defined [here](/push/push-template). Once done,
please follow the below steps:

1. Add the following in your project gradle

```json Gradle
allprojects {
    repositories {
        google()
        jcenter()
        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
    }
}
```

2. Add the following library in your app gradle. Please check the latest version
   [here](https://jitpack.io/#ravenappdev/raven-fcm-util).

```javascript
implementation 'com.github.ravenappdev:raven-android-sdk:1.0.6'
```

3. Initialize the SDK in Application onCreate

```javascript
RavenSdk.initialize(this, YOUR_APP_ID, YOUR_ACCOUNT_API_KEY);
```

4. Set user on signup/login. You can use any of the following methods to set
   user. Note that this will create a user if it does not exists in Raven. If it
   exists, it will simply update the user if there is any change.

```javascript
RavenSdk.setUserMobile(USER_ID, MOBILE);
RavenSdk.setUserEmail(USER_ID, EMAIL);
RavenSdk.setUser(USER_ID, MOBILE, EMAIL);
```

5. Set the Firebase device token on Raven.

```javascript
RavenSdk.setDeviceToken(TOKEN);
```

6. When you receive a message from Firebase in the onMessageReceived callback,
   please update Raven with DELIVERED status. If you have set up Notification
   click and dismiss receivers, please update Raven with CLICKED and DISMISSED
   statuses respectively. This method takes the Raven notificationId as an
   argument. Raven generates a unique notification id and attaches it in the
   data payload.

```javascript onMessageReceived Callback
val notificationId = remoteMessage.data["raven_notification_id"]

// When notification is delivered
RavenSdk.updateStatus(notificationId, Status.DELIVERED)

// When notification is clicked
RavenSdk.updateStatus(notificationId, Status.CLICKED)

// When notification is dismissed
RavenSdk.updateStatus(notificationId, Status.DISMISSED)
```

7. When the user logs out of your app, we need to de-register the device token.
   Call logout to logout the user from Raven.

```javascript
RavenSdk.logout();
```
