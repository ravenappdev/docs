title: "Environment"
description: "Environment helps you signify the type of App. There are three App environments"
---

1. **Development**:

   A working environment to play around with the platform.

2. **Staging**:

   Used for testing to test changes before releasing them to Production. Similar
   to the staging environment that you would have in your backend.

3. **Production**:

   This is the live production environment and should be treated carefully since
   it could affect your users.

<Info>
  Currently, Environments are only for your understanding and to add a semantic
  meaning to Apps. We do intend to add Environment based API rate-limiting later
  on.
