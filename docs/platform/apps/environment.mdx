1. **Test**:

   A working environment to play around with the platform.

2. **Production**:

   This is the live production environment and should be treated carefully since
   it could affect your users.

<Info>
  Currently, environments are only for your understanding and to add a semantic
  meaning to Apps. We do intend to add Environment based API rate-limiting later
  on.
