You can segregate your Integrations, Users, Events in different Apps. You can create multiple apps as
per your use-case like a Merchant and Customer app or separate environments like
a Production and Staging app.

### Default App

On sign up, we create a default app in your account: `your_account_name test`.
You can use this App to play around with the platform. In the default App, we
add a Raven SMS and Email Integration by default. You can use them in Events to
test the platform. To view them, go to the
[Integrations tab](https://console.ravenapp.dev/get-started) in the dashboard.
Check our [platform doc on Integrations](/platform/integrations) for more
details.

### Create a New App

- Go to the [Settings tab](https://console.ravenapp.dev/get-started) in the
  dashboard and click on New App button

- Fill in the details like App Name and Environment. Environment signifies which
  type of App this is. Learn more about Environment
  [here](/platform/apps/environment).

- You can switch to other Apps either by clicking `Switch App` button or from
  the dropdown in the left-side Nav bar.

  ### App ID

  Every app has an associated identifier: App ID. You will need this identifier
  in the Raven APIs.
